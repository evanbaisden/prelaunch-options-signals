#### Hypothesis Testing Results
1. **H₀: No abnormal returns around launches** → **REJECTED** (pre-launch period)
2. **H₀: No options anomaly predictive power** → **MIXED EVIDENCE**
3. **H₀: Random launch timing relative to earnings** → **REJECTED**

✅ **Statistically Significant Patterns**: Pre-launch information leakage (+0.62% average abnormal returns)  
✅ **Trading Strategy Viability**: High Sharpe ratio strategies (2.11) demonstrate exploitable opportunities  
✅ **Strategic Corporate Behavior**: Non-random timing of launches relative to earnings calendar  
✅ **Market Microstructure Effects**: Options volume anomalies correlate with subsequent price movements

### C. Investment Recommendations
1. **Institutional Investors**: Incorporate options flow analysis into technology sector research
2. **Quantitative Strategies**: Deploy systematic anomaly detection for event-driven alpha
3. **Risk Management**: Monitor options activity for early warning signals around key events
4. **Academic Researchers**: Replicate and extend methodology to other sectors and markets

### D. Final Assessment
This study provides **MODERATE SUPPORT** for the hypothesis that options markets contain exploitable information around product launches. While machine learning models show limited predictive power, traditional statistical analysis reveals meaningful patterns that can be systematically exploited through disciplined trading strategies.

The evidence suggests a **SEMI-EFFICIENT MARKET** where sophisticated investors can extract alpha through careful analysis of options flow anomalies, while broader market efficiency prevents easy or widespread exploitation of these patterns.
