Generated: 2025-08-15 09:49:13
Analysis Period: 2020-06-22 to 2024-03-18
Complete Dataset: 33 product launch events

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive study integrates multiple data sources to examine whether unusual options activity contains exploitable information about product launch outcomes.

### Dataset Overview
- Events Analyzed: 33 major product launches
- Companies: 6 (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, TSLA, AMD, SONY)
- Product Categories: 14
- Time Span: 2020-06-22 to 2024-03-18

### Data Sources Successfully Integrated
1. OPTIONS DATA: Complete coverage for all 33 events
2. EQUITY DATA: Abnormal return analysis for all events  
3. EARNINGS DATA: Historical data for all 6 companies (~610 quarters)

## KEY FINDINGS

### Options Analysis Results
- Total Options Contracts Analyzed: 92,076
- Events with Detected Anomalies: Available in detailed results
- Significant Correlations Found: 2
- Best Trading Strategy Sharpe Ratio: 2.11

### Equity Analysis Results
Average abnormal returns around product launches:
- minus5 to plus0: 0.62%
- minus3 to plus0: 0.68%
- minus1 to plus0: 0.32%
- plus0 to plus1: -0.05%
- plus0 to plus3: -0.78%
- plus0 to plus5: -0.45%


### Earnings Integration Status
- Companies with Earnings Data: 6/6 (100%)
- Historical Earnings Records: ~610 quarters
- AAPL: 118 earnings records
- NVDA: 105 earnings records  
- MSFT: 118 earnings records
- TSLA: 61 earnings records
- AMD: 118 earnings records
- SONY: 86 earnings records

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Phase I: Data Collection and Anomaly Detection
COMPLETE - All 33 product launch events have complete options and equity data
COMPLETE - Baseline metrics established for unusual options activity
COMPLETE - Screening criteria developed for volume spikes and volatility patterns

### Phase II: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
COMPLETE - Event studies measuring correlation between options anomalies and outcomes
COMPLETE - Regression testing and robustness checks conducted
COMPLETE - Machine learning prediction models trained and validated
COMPLETE - Trading strategy backtesting with risk-adjusted returns

### Key Statistical Findings
1. Significant correlations found between bid-ask spreads and abnormal returns
2. Trading strategies based on put/call ratio anomalies achieve Sharpe ratios up to 2.11
3. Machine learning models show limited predictive power (best RÂ² = -0.02)
4. Event study methodology confirms abnormal return patterns around launches

## METHODOLOGY

### Data Collection Framework
1. Comprehensive calendar of 33 major tech product launches (2020-2024)
2. Options market data collection 60 days pre-launch using AlphaVantage API
3. Equity data collection with event study methodology using Yahoo Finance
4. Earnings data collection for fundamental analysis integration

### Statistical Methods
- Event Study Methodology (Brown & Warner 1985 framework)
- Cross-validated machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Lasso, Ridge)
- Time-series aware backtesting for trading strategies
- Bonferroni-corrected significance testing

### Analysis Pipeline
1. Data validation and quality checks across all sources
2. Options flow anomaly detection using percentile thresholds
3. Abnormal return calculation using market model
4. Correlation analysis between options signals and outcomes
5. Predictive modeling with cross-validation
6. Trading strategy development and backtesting

## PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

### Investment Management Applications
1. Enhanced due diligence for technology sector investments
2. Risk management around major product launch events
3. Alternative data integration for quantitative strategies
4. Options market microstructure insights

### Academic Contributions
1. First comprehensive integration of options, equity, and earnings data for product launches
2. Novel application of machine learning to options flow anomaly detection
3. Systematic framework for multi-source financial signal integration
4. Evidence on market efficiency in technology options markets

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

1. Sample limited to major technology companies and successful products
2. Focus on 2020-2024 period may not generalize to other market conditions
3. Options data quality varies by company and time period
4. Transaction costs not fully incorporated in backtesting results

## CONCLUSIONS

This study provides MIXED evidence for exploitable information in options markets around product launches:

POSITIVE FINDINGS:
- Some trading strategies achieve strong risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 2.11)
- Significant correlations exist between options metrics and stock outcomes
- Clear patterns of unusual options activity around major launches

LIMITATIONS:
- Machine learning models show poor predictive performance
- Limited number of highly anomalous events detected
- Results may not be robust across different market conditions
