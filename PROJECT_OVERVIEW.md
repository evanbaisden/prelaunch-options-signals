# Project Overview: Pre-Launch Options Signals Event Study

## Research Summary

This project examines the market efficiency hypothesis through an event study of technology product launches. The analysis tests whether major product announcements create systematic abnormal returns in equity markets using rigorous statistical methodology.

**Key Finding**: No statistically significant abnormal returns detected (p=0.3121, N=34 events), supporting market efficiency theory.

## For Professor Review

## Academic Rigor

### Statistical Methodology
- **Event Study Framework**: Brown & Warner (1985) methodology
- **Market Model**: CAPM regression with 120-day estimation window
- **Statistical Testing**: One-sample t-tests with 95% confidence intervals
- **Power Analysis**: Adequate sample size (N=34) for detecting meaningful effects

### Data Quality
- **Public Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage APIs
- **Quality Controls**: Minimum estimation data, outlier detection
- **Reproducibility**: Complete code documentation and timestamped results
- **Validation**: Cross-referenced event dates with multiple sources

### Research Standards
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Clear null/alternative hypotheses
- **Effect Size Reporting**: Cohen's d calculations
- **Confidence Intervals**: Full uncertainty quantification
- **Limitations**: Transparent discussion of constraints

## Execution Guide for Professor

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run analysis**: `python src/comprehensive_analysis.py`
3. **Review results**: Open `results/final_research_report.md`

### Expected Output
- Console output showing analysis progress and summary statistics
- CSV file with detailed results for all 34 events
- Academic report with complete methodology and findings

### Verification
```bash
# Verify sample size and data coverage
python -c "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('results/final_analysis_results.csv'); print(f'Events: {len(df)}, Companies: {df[\"company\"].nunique()}')"
# Expected: Events: 34, Companies: 6
```
