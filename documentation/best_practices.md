# Best Practices for Prelaunch Options Signals Analysis

This document outlines methodological best practices and quality standards for conducting market microstructure research around technology product launches.

## Statistical Methods

### Event Study Methodology
- **Baseline Period**: Use 60 trading days pre-announcement to establish normal patterns
- **Event Windows**: 5 days before/after for event-specific signals, 20+ days for period analysis  
- **Statistical Testing**: Apply appropriate significance tests (t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum)
- **Multiple Testing**: Consider Bonferroni or FDR corrections when testing multiple hypotheses
- **Outlier Handling**: Use robust statistics (median, MAD) for datasets with extreme values

### Return Calculations
- **Price Data**: Always use adjusted close prices to account for splits/dividends
- **Return Definition**: Clearly distinguish between daily average returns and cumulative event returns
- **Market Adjustment**: Consider benchmarking against sector ETFs (XLK, SOXX) to isolate company-specific effects
- **Calendar vs Trading Days**: Use trading days for all calculations to avoid weekend/holiday bias

### Volume Analysis
- **Baseline Calculation**: Use 20-day rolling average with minimum 10 periods for early data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score method with thresholds at 1.645 (95%), 2.326 (99%), 2.576 (99.5%)
- **Robust Methods**: Apply median absolute deviation for datasets with extreme outliers
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Consider day-of-week and expiration-week effects for options volume

## Data Quality Standards

### Input Validation
- **Required Fields**: Date, Adj Close, Volume must be present and non-null
- **Range Checks**: Prices > 0, volumes ≥ 0, reasonable price movements (<50% daily)
- **Continuity**: No gaps > 7 trading days without explanation
- **Consistency**: Verify High ≥ Low ≥ 0 and Open/Close within High/Low range

### Quality Scoring
- **Automated Checks**: Implement programmatic validation with pass/fail scores
- **Threshold**: Require data quality score ≥ 0.8 for inclusion in analysis
- **Documentation**: Log all quality issues and remediation steps
- **Transparency**: Report data quality scores alongside analysis results

## Research Standards

### Reproducibility
- **Version Control**: Track all code changes with meaningful commit messages
- **Environment**: Pin all package versions in requirements.txt
- **Parameters**: Store all analysis parameters in version-controlled configuration
- **Random Seeds**: Set seeds for any stochastic processes (bootstrap, permutation tests)
- **Metadata**: Save complete parameter sets with every analysis run

### Documentation
- **Methodology**: Document all calculation formulas and statistical assumptions
- **Data Sources**: Clearly identify data providers and collection methods
- **Limitations**: Explicitly state sample size, time period, and generalizability constraints
- **Updates**: Maintain change log for methodology modifications

### Bias Mitigation
- **Selection Bias**: Use objective criteria for event selection, document exclusions
- **Look-Ahead Bias**: Only use information available at the time of each event
- **Survivorship Bias**: Consider delisted companies if relevant to analysis period
- **Publication Bias**: Report both significant and non-significant results

## Code Quality

### Architecture
- **Modularity**: Separate data loading, analysis, and visualization into distinct modules
- **Configuration**: Centralize parameters in config files, avoid hardcoded values
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful failure modes with informative error messages
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions with known inputs/outputs
- **Integration Tests**: Validate end-to-end analysis pipeline
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions (missing data, extreme values, single observations)
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure consistent results across code changes

### Performance
- **Caching**: Cache expensive computations (API calls, large calculations)
- **Vectorization**: Use pandas/numpy operations instead of loops where possible
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage for large datasets
- **Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in computationally intensive analyses

## Security and Ethics

### Data Security
- **API Keys**: Store in environment variables, never commit to version control
- **Access Control**: Limit data access to authorized personnel only
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for all API communications
- **Backup**: Implement secure backup procedures for valuable datasets

### Research Ethics
- **Inside Information**: Ensure all analysis uses only public information
- **Market Manipulation**: Do not use research results to manipulate securities prices
- **Fair Use**: Respect data provider terms of service and licensing agreements
- **Attribution**: Properly credit data sources and methodological influences

## Reporting Standards

### Results Presentation
- **Precision**: Report appropriate significant figures based on data quality
- **Uncertainty**: Include confidence intervals and standard errors
- **Effect Sizes**: Report both statistical significance and economic significance
- **Visualizations**: Use clear, unbiased charts with appropriate scales and labels

### Peer Review
- **Code Review**: Have analysis code reviewed by independent researcher
- **Methodology Review**: Validate statistical approaches with domain experts
- **Results Validation**: Reproduce key findings using alternative methods
- **External Validation**: Test findings on out-of-sample data when possible

### Publication
- **Preregistration**: Consider preregistering analysis plans to avoid p-hacking
- **Open Science**: Make code and data available subject to privacy/licensing constraints
- **Replication**: Provide sufficient detail for independent replication
- **Updates**: Maintain version control of published analyses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Statistical Issues
- **Multiple Testing**: Don't ignore multiple comparison problems
- **Data Snooping**: Avoid iterative hypothesis testing on the same dataset  
- **Overfitting**: Don't optimize parameters on the same data used for testing
- **Sample Size**: Ensure adequate power for detecting economically meaningful effects

### Data Issues
- **Temporal Alignment**: Verify event dates align with market data dates
- **Corporate Actions**: Account for stock splits, spin-offs, mergers during analysis period
- **Market Microstructure**: Consider bid-ask spreads, trading halts, circuit breakers
- **Time Zones**: Ensure consistent time zone handling for global markets

### Interpretation Issues
- **Causality**: Remember correlation does not imply causation
- **Generalization**: Don't extrapolate beyond the scope of the analysis sample
- **Economic Significance**: Distinguish statistical significance from economic importance
- **Context**: Consider broader market conditions and sector-specific factors
