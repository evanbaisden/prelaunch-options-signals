"""
Phase 2 Analysis Package - Options trading signals and advanced analytics.

This package extends Phase 1 analysis with options market data and sophisticated
trading signal detection. Phase 2 focuses on:

- Options flow analysis (volume, open interest, unusual activity)
- Greeks-based risk assessment and hedging patterns
- Advanced statistical models (machine learning, time series)
- Cross-market correlation analysis
- Real-time signal detection and alerting

Planned modules:
- options_data: Options data collection and processing
- flow_analysis: Options flow and unusual activity detection
- greeks: Greeks calculation and risk analysis
- ml_models: Machine learning signal detection models
- realtime: Real-time data processing and alerting
- backtesting: Strategy backtesting and performance analysis

Usage:
    from src.phase2 import Phase2Analyzer
    
    analyzer = Phase2Analyzer()
    results = analyzer.run_options_analysis()

Status: PHASE 2 IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
This is a placeholder package for future development.
