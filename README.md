# Pre-Launch Options Signals: Event Study Analysis

**An empirical examination of technology product launch effects on equity and options markets**

## Research Objective

This study investigates whether major technology product launches create systematic abnormal returns in equity markets and corresponding signals in options markets. Using comprehensive event study methodology, the analysis examines 34 product launch events across six major technology companies from 2020-2024.

## Methodology Overview

**Event Study Framework**: Market-adjusted abnormal returns calculated using CAPM regression with 120-day estimation windows. Statistical significance tested using one-sample t-tests with appropriate confidence intervals and power analysis.

**Sample Selection**: 34 major product launches from Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Tesla, AMD, and Sony, representing consumer electronics, semiconductor hardware, gaming platforms, and electric vehicles.

**Data Sources**: 
- Equity data: Yahoo Finance via yfinance API
- Options data: Alpha Vantage Historical Options API  
- Market benchmark: S&P 500 Index

## Key Findings

**Equity Results**: No statistically significant abnormal returns detected in the 5-day pre-announcement window (p=0.3121, N=34 events). Mean abnormal return of 0.62% with 95% confidence interval [-0.61%, 1.85%].

**Options Results**: Pilot analysis of 3 recent events shows call-dominated flow (P/C ratio 0.55) with high volume activity across all analyzed product launches (1.29M avg contracts/event).

**Market Efficiency**: Results support the semi-strong form of market efficiency for anticipated technology product launches, consistent with efficient information incorporation in modern markets.

**Statistical Power**: Sample size provides adequate power to detect economically meaningful effects (N≥30), supporting robust conclusions about the absence of systematic abnormal returns.

## Research Standards

**Academic Rigor**: Follows established event study methodology (Brown & Warner, 1985; MacKinlay, 1997) with proper statistical testing, confidence intervals, and power analysis.

**Reproducibility**: All code, data sources, and analysis parameters documented for independent verification.

**Statistical Transparency**: Clear reporting of sample sizes, effect sizes, confidence intervals, and limitations.

## Technical Requirements

**Dependencies**: Python 3.8+, pandas, numpy, scipy, yfinance
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Coverage

**Time Period**: 2020-2024 (post-COVID technology market conditions)
**Event Types**: Product announcements, launch events, technology revelations
**Market Conditions**: Bull and bear market periods, varying volatility regimes
**Quality Controls**: Minimum estimation data requirements, outlier detection, missing data handling

## Academic Contribution

This study contributes to the event study literature by providing a well-powered analysis of technology product launch effects using modern data and methodology. The null findings support market efficiency theory while establishing a robust framework for future research.

**Limitations**: Focus on major product launches, daily frequency data, potential confounding events, technology sector concentration.
