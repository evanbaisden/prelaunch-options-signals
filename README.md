# Pre-Launch Options Signals: Comprehensive Financial Analysis

**An empirical examination of whether unusual options activity contains exploitable information about technology product launch outcomes**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This study investigates whether options markets contain predictive signals around major technology product launches by integrating three data sources: **options flow analysis**, **equity event studies**, and **earnings impact measurement**. 

**Research Question**: Do options market anomalies predict product launch success and subsequent earnings performance?

## 📊 Dataset Summary

- **33 Product Launch Events** (2020-2024)
- **6 Major Technology Companies**: Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Tesla, AMD, Sony
- **92,076 Options Contracts Analyzed**
- **~610 Quarterly Earnings Records**
- **100% Data Coverage**: Every event has complete options and equity data

## 🔬 Methodology

### Phase I: Data Collection and Anomaly Detection
- **Options Data**: AlphaVantage Historical Options API (60-day pre-launch windows)
- **Equity Data**: Yahoo Finance with event study methodology (Brown & Warner 1985)
- **Earnings Data**: AlphaVantage EARNINGS and EARNINGS_ESTIMATES APIs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Volume spikes, P/C ratio thresholds, IV percentiles

### Phase II: Statistical Analysis and Integration
- **Event Studies**: Market-adjusted abnormal returns with CAPM regression
- **Correlation Analysis**: Options metrics vs. stock returns vs. earnings surprises
- **Machine Learning**: Cross-validated prediction models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Lasso, Ridge)
- **Trading Strategies**: Backtested with risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe ratios

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Complete Analysis
```bash

```

## 📈 Key Findings

### Options Analysis Results
- **Total Contracts**: 92,076 analyzed across 33 events
- **Anomaly Detection**: 26 events with unusual patterns detected
- **Significant Correlations**: 2 relationships found (bid-ask spread → abnormal returns)
- **Best Trading Strategy**: Sharpe ratio 2.11 with 100% hit rate

### Equity Event Study Results
- **Market Efficiency**: Mixed evidence for semi-strong form efficiency
- **Abnormal Returns**: Various patterns across different time windows
- **Statistical Significance**: Event-specific results with proper significance testing

### Earnings Integration Results
- **Date Alignment**: 100% of events properly matched to earnings (avg 42 days)
- **Fundamental Impact**: Direct link between product launches and earnings outcomes
- **Predictive Power**: Framework established for testing options → earnings relationships

## 🔢 Detailed Statistical Results

### Complete Quantitative Analysis Available In:
- **`results/options_analysis_data.json`**: Every contract's metrics, correlations, p-values
- **`results/equity_analysis_results.csv`**: Event-by-event abnormal returns, t-statistics
- **`data/raw/earnings/*.csv`**: Complete earnings histories with surprises

### Key Statistical Findings:
- **Correlation**: `avg_bid_ask_spread` → `abnormal_return`: r=0.311 (p<0.001)
- **Trading Performance**: High P/C ratio strategy: +5.24% return, Sharpe 2.11
- **Machine Learning**: Best model R² = -0.020 (limited predictive power)
- **Event Study**: Mixed statistical significance across events and time periods
